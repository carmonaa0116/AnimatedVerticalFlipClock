# VerticalAlignedClock

A minimalistic vertical aligned digital clock implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

This project displays a digital clock with hours, minutes, and seconds arranged vertically in columns. Each digit scrolls smoothly to its current number every second, creating a vertical rolling effect.

The clock digits are styled using CSS for a modern and clean look with a subtle gradient background.

## Features

- Vertical digit alignment for hours, minutes, and seconds
- Smooth animated scrolling effect between digits
- Responsive design that centers the clock in the viewport
- Simple and modular code with separation of concerns (HTML, CSS, JS)
